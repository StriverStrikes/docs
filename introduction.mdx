## Overview

AI-powered meeting agents that automatically:

- üìπ Record high-quality (Audio and Video / Audio Only)
- üéôÔ∏è Generate accurate transcripts  
- ü§ñ Participate as virtual attendees  

## Core Concepts

### What is an Agent?

The fundamental entity that:

1. Joins meetings as a participant  
2. Captures all meeting data in real-time  

Agents maintain access to:
- **Live video/audio streams**
- **Participant lists and engagement**
- **Meeting metadata**

## Video and Audio Recording
Meeting agents automatically generate **recordings** during calls.  
You can retrieve the recording URL by fetching the meeting using the **Retrieve Meeting Data** API.  
The `recording url` field contains a **pre-signed URL**, allowing you to stream or download the recording.

## Transcription

You can generate transcripts in two ways:

1. **Platform Captions:** Use the meeting platform's **native closed captioning**.  
2. **AI Transcription:** Leverage **third-party AI transcription** services for more advanced and customizable transcriptions.  

Here's a comparison to help you choose the best option:

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------ |-----------------------------------------|
| **Source**            | Meeting platform's closed captions        | Third-party AI transcription service    |
| **Accuracy**          | Platform-dependent, may vary              | Higher accuracy with advanced NLP models |
| **Per-Word Timestamp**| Not available                             | Available                               |
| **Real-Time**         | Yes                                       | Yes                                     |
| **Cost**              | Free                                      | Additional cost for AI service usage    |

### **Recommendation**
- Use **Platform Captions** for basic, real-time transcription with no extra cost.  
- Use **AI Transcription** for more accurate, timestamped, and customizable transcripts.
