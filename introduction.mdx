## Overview

Record meetings, stream audio and video, generate transcripts, and so much more.

## What is an agent?

An agent is the fundamental entity for accessing a given meeting's data.

Through an agent, you can interface with a meeting's video, audio, participants, and metadata in real-time during a call, as well as after the call for as long as the data is retained.

## Video and audio

Meeting agents generate a recording that can be accessed in the videoUrl field of the agent when fetched from Retrieve agent. The field will contain a pre-signed S3 URL that you can use to play the video and processed accordingly.

## Transcription

There are two ways to generate transcripts:

- **Meeting Caption Transcription:** Using the meeting platform's native closed captioning feature to generate a transcript in real-time.
- **AI Transcription:** Using a 3rd party AI transcription integration.
Which of these you choose depends on your requirements, and we recommend reviewing the documentation for each to decide which best fits your use case.

## Customizing your agents

Meeting agents are fully white label-able to match your branding:

- **Output an Image:** Configure your agents to output a custom image.
- **Set the name for your agents:** Change the name of your agents by providing an agent_name parameter in the Create agent request.
